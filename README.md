<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Agent Using MCTS in Rust</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>

This project is an implementation of a tic-tac-toe game agent that uses Monte Carlo Search Trees (MCTS) for decision-making. Developed in Rust, the aim for me was to

<ol>
  <li>solidify my Rust knowledge which I learned a month prior to starting this project</li>
  <li>learn about MCTS</li>
</ol>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>MCTS Algorithm:</b> Employs Monte Carlo Search Trees for robust and efficient game decision-making.</li>
  <li><b>Rust Implementation:</b> Built with Rust for potential of efficient memory management and performance.</li>
  <li><b>Interactive Game:</b> Allows users to play against the AI in a simple terminal interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites<h3>
